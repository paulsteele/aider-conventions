When writing code, follow these principles without deviating:
* Code should aim to not be clever.
* Code should be as minimal as possible to achieve the goal.
* Code should be testable.
* When naming things, the name should describe the intent.
* When you think you need to add a comment to something consider if you should instead make it a function.
* Follow convention of existing code.
